# "FeelFree – Your Emotional Support Chatbot"

## "About the Project"

Sometimes we all go through tough days — feeling anxious, stressed, or just low. But not everyone feels comfortable opening up to someone. That’s why I built "MindMate", a chatbot that understands how you're feeling and offers supportive responses. It uses AI to detect emotions and sentiment in your messages and replies with kindness — just like a friend who listens.

If things feel too intense, the chatbot even recommends professional help. Whether you're a student under pressure or anyone who just needs to vent, MindMate is here for you.

## "What it Does"

- Understands the "emotion" behind your text (like joy, sadness, fear, etc.)
- Checks your "sentiment" (positive or negative)
- Sends back kind, helpful, or calming responses
- Gives suggestions like journaling, breathing exercises, or helpful resources
- If something seems serious (e.g., severe sadness), it gently recommends seeking help

## "Tech I Used"

- "Python" for all the logic and model handling
- "Hugging Face Transformers" for pre-trained NLP models:
  - "nateraw/bert-base-uncased-emotion" for emotion detection
  - "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" for sentiment analysis
- "Streamlit" for building the web app (simple and clean UI)

## "Sample Output"

User input:  
"I feel like nothing is working out for me."

Detected emotion: "sadness"  
Detected sentiment: "negative"

Chatbot reply:  
"I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You're not alone — would you like to try a short calming exercise or talk to someone?"

## "Why This Project Matters to Me"

Mental health is personal. I’ve seen friends and classmates struggle silently — and I’ve been there too. This project is my small attempt to make emotional support a bit more accessible and stigma-free, using what I’m learning in AI.
